# Netflix CLone 
## ðŸ“œ About this project 
A SwiftUI project I made following Nikita Thomas' [SwiftUI 2 - Build Netflix Clone - SwiftUI Best Practices](https://www.udemy.com/course/swiftui-netflix) course. 
## ðŸ’­ Main takeaways
- The Modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel (MVVM) pattern - an iOS dev best practice for destructuring views from their associated data. I was used to following my own (admittedly bad) habits after charting my own course in a yearlong Swift course in high school, and was grateful to learn how apps are organized by real SWEs. My next goal is to implement the MVVM pattern in an app that uses real networking data. 
- Animations & transitions - I've always shied away from animations in fears of breaking my apps. Nikita's tutorial gave a helpful guide for calculating and executing the offset + appearance of animations on various components.
- Lots and LOTS of files - this was by far the biggest, most visually complex app I've made so far. I'm hoping to implement more functional code (API calls, local storage... etc) to make it more useful in the future :)
